# 

The weather station using Arduino Uno microcontroller is a device designed to measure and record 
various weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The system is 
built using an Arduino Uno microcontroller, sensors, and other necessary components to measure and 
store the data.


## Instruction

- Ensure all files & libraries are included.
- Two Arduino boards are connected to each other, and their respective codes are in "Arduino 1" and "Arduino 2".
- Download and upload the code to an Arduino Uno if you have a physical microcontroller. Otherwise, you can use the online simulation tool such as Tinkercad.
